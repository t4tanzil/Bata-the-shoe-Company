**Bata** - The Shoe Company is a website project designed as part of my 2nd semester coursework at Georgian College.
 Inspired by Bata, a globally renowned footwear brand, this project demonstrates my ability to design and develop a sleek,
 functional, and user-friendly website. I worked on this project independently, applying my knowledge of web development and
 professional design principles.

**Project Highlights**
Product Pages: Six product pages, showcasing shoes for men, women, and kids.
Product List Page: A comprehensive overview of all available products.
Essential Sections: Includes an About Us page and a Contact Us page for a complete browsing experience.
Wireframe Design: The website structure and layout were planned and designed using Figma, and the wireframe PDF is included in the root folder.
**Key Features**
Responsive Design: Ensures seamless functionality across devices.
Global Navigation: Consistent header, footer, and breadcrumb navigation for easy access.
Organized Layout: Products are categorized into sections for men, women, and kids.
Minimalistic and Functional UI: Focusing on ease of navigation and professional aesthetics.
This project allowed me to enhance my web development skills while exploring real-world design concepts. The use of Figma for wireframing showcases my ability to incorporate design tools into the development process, ensuring a well-structured and visually appealing outcome.
