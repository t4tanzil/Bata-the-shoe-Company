# Bata-the-shoe-Company
# **Project Description:**  This website project showcases a sleek and functional shoe store inspired by Bata, a globally renowned footwear brand. Designed as a learning exercise, the site includes key features such as product pages, a product list page, and essential sections like About Us and Contact Us. While this project is a concise version featuring six product pages, it demonstrates my ability to replicate professional design principles and user-friendly functionality. A wireframe PDF is included in the root folder to outline the structure.

Thank you for exploring this project!
